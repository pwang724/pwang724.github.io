<p>Our capacity to learn associations gives us a measure of control over our environment by enabling us to predict and act on future events. For instance, upon hearing blaring sirens, we stop what we are doing and scan our surroundings for imminent danger. How do our brains learn to connect two stimuli together?</p>

<p>I adapted two recent technologies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12354"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3329"><sup>2</sup></a> to track neural activity in a population of neurons (right) with light. This allowed me to ‘image’ neural activity when mice were actively learning to associate an odor with a water reward (left).</p>

<p>I found that different prefrontal areas performed unique value computations during learning. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) rapidly learns to signal positive value in response to cues that predicted reward. Its representation reflects knowledge of task structure, or “state space”<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313010398"><sup>3</sup></a>, and further experiments using optogenetics<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1525"><sup>4</sup></a> (controlling neurons with light) to turn off it off revealed that the OFC is indispensable for learning. After learning, we show that the OFC transfers what it has learned to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), where it is further processed and then stored long-term.</p>

<p>We made an important observation: once the task has been learned with a single odor, the OFC turns silent. Why would a learned representation vanish? The process of forgetting may ‘refresh’ the OFC so it can learn new tasks. In other words, the gradual accumulation of information from the past may overload its capacity to be cognitively flexible in the present. Once it solves a task, it unloads its knowledge to long-term storage units to free up space. Indeed, the time when OFC’s representation degrades is exactly when other brain regions such as the mPFC take over.</p>

<p>The OFC computes value and likely informs downstream areas to take appropriate actions to get reward. This framework transfers quite naturally to reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as actor-critic (AC) learning, where the critic network also computes value and informs the actor network which action to take next. What can the critic network in AC learning teach us about the OFC, and vice versa?</p>

<p>After training a recurrent AC network on our behavioral task, I found that the machine critic reproduced much of the neural dynamics that we observe in the OFC. However, while the machine critic served no purpose after the actor has learned an optimal policy, it was still pumping out value estimates. By turning itself off after an optimal policy has been learned, the OFC may have implemented a solution that may be more efficient at learning multiple tasks than current RL algorithms. I am currently interested in finding constraints on network structure that would cause a network to segment itself into distinct “playground” and “storage” modules during training.</p>
