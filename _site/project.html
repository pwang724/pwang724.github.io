    <p>Our capacity to learn associations enables us to predict future events and gives us a measure of control over our environment through taking the appropriate actions. For instance, upon hearing blaring sirens, we stop what we are doing and scan our surroundings for imminent danger. I asked a simple question in my PhD: how do our brains learn to connect two stimuli together?</p>

<p>I needed to see how brain circuits are changing during the course of learning to infer the algorithm that our brains use to learn associations. This has been technically challenging until the recent development of two important technologies <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12354"><sup>1</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3329"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>

Using this approach, I tracked the neural activities (right) of a population of neurons in many brain regions while mice were actively learning an appetitive association between an odor and a water reward (left). After multiple days of training, mice start to lick in anticipation of the incoming water drop, since they are learning that the smell of a particular odor predicts the reward. I then analyzed these images to extract meaningful changes in neural activity during learning to understand how the brain learns associations.</p>

<p>I found that different prefrontal associative areas performed unique value computations during learning. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) learned quickly to signal the positive value of cues that predicted reward during training. Its representation reflected knowledge of task structure, or “state space”<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627313010398"><sup>3</sup></a>, and further experiments using optogenetics<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nn1525"><sup>4</sup></a> (controlling neurons with light) to turn off the OFC revealed that it is indispensable for learning associations. After learning, this representation is transferred to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), where it slowly refines itself to form a stable representation of positive value (in response to rewarded odors) and negative value (in response to unrewarded odors).</p>

<p>We had an important observation: once the task has been learned with a single odor, the OFC becomes silent, and it remains silent even when mice encounter novel odors that haven’t been previously learned. Why would a learned representation vanish? I think the brain may allocate a portion of its real estate to be a playground where experimentation and hypothesis testing can take place. Once it solves a task, it may unload what it has learned to storage units located elsewhere to free up space. Otherwise, the gradual accumulation of information would overload its ability to learn new things. Indeed, the time when OFC’s representation degrades is exactly when other brain regions such as the mPFC takes over.</p>

<p>Finally, I trained a recurrent actor-critic (AC) network on our behavioral task and it was able to reproduce much of what was observed in the OFC in our imaging experiments. From this model, I realized that the critic network in AC learning actually serves no purpose after the optimal policy has already been learned. Therefore, its value representation can vanish without any effect on behavior. If OFC can be thought of as a critic network, then our brain is likely coming up with a solution that is more efficient at learning multiple tasks than current reinforcement learning models. Therefore, I am motivated to find constraints on network structure that would cause a network to segment itself into distinct playground and storage modules during training.</p>

<!-- I then adapted this technology to

1. Genetically engineered calcium indicators that convert voltage into light. Instead of listening to waveforms, we directly visualize neural activity through changes in fluorescence. This allows us to track the neural activity of a large population of neurons across time.

2. Microendoscopic lenses. Brain regions thought to underlie associative learning are lodged deep within, and can't be imaged through any conventional methods that only scan the brain surface. But if we implant a lens through the cranium until it is directly on top of these regions, we can see what neurons below are doing. -->
