<p>Close your eyes and turn your head. Despite not having feedback from your surroundings, you still know the direction that your head is facing. How is this done?</p>

<p>If you know how fast and how long your head is turning, then you can use this information to update your estimate of head direction. A conceptual realization of a neural circuit capable of computing head direction without sensory feedback was proposed more than 20 years ago<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/890-a-model-of-the-neural-basis-of-the-rats-sense-of-direction"><sup>1</sup></a>. This schematic has two modular components: ring neurons that maintain current head direction, and angular velocity (AV) neurons that update head direction in response to movement.</p>

<p>Ring neurons (image below) are a set of neurons connected to form a topological ring. The angular estimate of the current head direction is encoded in the radial position of the set of active neurons in this ring, called a bump. Local excitation (red) between adjacently connected ring neurons allow activity to be maintained over time, and long-range inhibition (blue) between non-neighboring neurons limits the size of the activity bump to be a subset of ring neurons.</p>

</p>

<p>How does this circuit update position when the head turns? Turning motion activates a separate population of either left and right angular velocity (AV) neurons (orange), and these neurons are asymmetrically connected to ring neurons (blue) and cause the bump to move in the direction of motion, which is right-ward in the image below (image taken from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22343">here</a>).</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

<p>Quite amazingly, two research groups <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22343"><sup>2</sup></a><sup>,</sup><a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/23496"><sup>3</sup></a> independently uncovered a physical instantiation of such a circuit within the fruit fly nervous system for tracking head direction. There is a physical ring of neurons within the fly brain that functions like a ring attractor, and two sets of AV neurons that shift the bump of activity in the ring left and right.</p>

<p>Could this be the only instantiation that supports head direction integration? To test this, we trained a recurrent neural network to update head direction in response to turning velocity. The machine indeed learns to integrate turning motion to produce an accurate estimate of its current head orientation. Through this process, it produces a ring attractor! Shown below is the connection weight matrix between ring neurons. Ring neurons send strong excitatory connections to immediate neighbors (2-3 neurons apart) but inhibit neighbors that are about 45 degrees away (4-6 neurons apart). Therefore, this network exhibits local excitation and global inhibition.</p>

</p>

<p>How does the machine learn to respond to turning input? It also learns to produce two sets of AV neurons, one that shifts weights leftwards and another rightwards (figure below). One set of neurons (dotted red neurons) are activated by a turn right command and shifts the ring attractor bump (in black) rightwards. Another set of neurons are activated by a turn left command (dotted blue neurons) and shift the ring neurons leftwards through the same mechanism. These neurons also inhibit ring neurons that are in the direction opposite of the turning motion. While inhibitory connections has not been revealed by experiments thus far, it may be an essential component for stable angular integration.</p>

</p>

<p>The machine therefore has evolved the same structural principles as biology in solving a dynamic task. Such a circuit is likely fed into a broader circuit that is then used for path integration, and we are currently investigating the architecture that a machine builds to determine its own position within 2-D space.</p>
