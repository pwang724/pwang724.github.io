___
## Research

__2018-2019__<br/>
__Postdoctoral Fellow__<br/>
Columbia University<br/>
Project: artificial neural networks learn the same architecture as the [head-direction system](/head_direction.md) when trained to navigate, and learn the same architecture as the [olfactory system](/olfaction_evolution.md) when trained to smell

__2012-2018__<br/>
__PhD in Neuroscience__<br/>
Columbia University<br/>
Advisors:
[Richard Axel](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/richard-axel-md) and
[Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd)

Project: the orbitofrontal cortex and the medial prefrontal cortex encode predictive value and function sequentially to consolidate the learning of new associations. See more [here](/project.md)

__2011-2012__<br/>
MIT<br/>
Advisor: [Elly Nedivi](https://nedivilab.mit.edu/) <br/>
Project: I studied the short-term structural dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in V1 neurons through chronic two-photon imaging of dendritic arbors

__2008-2011__<br/>
Cornell University<br/>
Advisor: [Joe Fetcho](http://pages.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/Fetcho/)<br/>
Project: I attempted to develop a method to deliver DNA to a single neuron's pre-synaptic partners using retrograde viral transport in larval zebrafish

__2009__<br/>
Howard Hughes Research Campus, Janelia Farm<br/>
Advisor: [Scott Sternson](https://www.janelia.org/lab/sternson-lab)<br/>
Project: I assisted my post-doctoral mentor, Yexica Aponte, to ask whether optogenetic activation of NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus of mice in the hypothalamus is sufficient to induce hunger
