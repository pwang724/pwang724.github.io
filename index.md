I work at the intersection of experiment and computation to understand the brain. Currently, I am a post-doctoral fellow studying the cerebellum in the [Karl Deisseroth's lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/) at Stanford University.

I was a PhD student with [Richard Axel](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/richard-axel-md) and [Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd) at Columbia University. I studied how [value was imposed during olfactory learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.07.033) with a series of calcium imaging and optogenetic experiments in the piriform cortex, OFC, and mPFC. I also modeled the evolution of the [head direction system](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_HklSeREtPB.html) and the [olfactory system](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.439917v1) using artificial neural networks. After graduate school and before post-doc, I was an AI resident at X where I worked with [Alex Wiltschko's](https://research.google/people/105779/) team at Google Brain to infer smell from chemical structure.
