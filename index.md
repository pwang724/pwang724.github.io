I work at the intersection of experiment and computation to understand the brain. Currently, I am a post-doctoral fellow studying the cerebellum in the [Deisseroth lab](https://web.stanford.edu/group/dlab/) at Stanford University.

Previously, with friends and collaborators, I modeled the evolution of the [head direction system](https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_HklSeREtPB.html) and the [olfactory system](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.15.439917v1) using artificial neural networks. I also studied how [value was imposed during olfactory learning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2020.07.033) through a series of calcium imaging and optogenetic experiments in the piriform cortex, OFC, and mPFC.
