## Research

__2012-2018__<br/>
__PhD in Neuroscience__<br/>
Columbia University<br/>
Advisors:
[Richard Axel](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/richard-axel-md) and
[Larry Abbott](https://zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/larry-f-abbott-phd)

Project: I asked how associations are learned by tracking the population activity of multiple cognitive brain regions during learning. I found that the orbitofrontal cortex encodes predictive value and is important during initial learning. It then transfers what it has learned to the medial prefrontal cortex for long-term storage. See more [here](/project.md)

__2011-2012__<br/>
MIT<br/>
Advisor: [Elly Nedivi](https://nedivilab.mit.edu/) <br/>
Project: I studied the short-term structural dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in excitatory and inhibitory V1 neurons by chronically imaging their dendritic arbors using 2-photon exitation

__2008-2011__<br/>
Cornell University<br/>
Advisor: [Joe Fetcho](http://pages.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/Fetcho/)<br/>
Project: I attempted to develop a method to deliver DNA to a given neuron's pre-synaptic partners through retrograde viral transport in larval zebrafish

__2009__<br/>
Howard Hughes Research Campus, Janelia Farm<br/>
Advisor: [Scott Sternson](https://www.janelia.org/lab/sternson-lab)<br/>
Project: I assisted my post-doctoral mentor, Yexica Aponte, to ask whether optogenetic activation of NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus is sufficient to induce hunger
