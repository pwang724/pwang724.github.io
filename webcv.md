## Research

__PhD in Neuroscience__<br/>
2012-2018<br/>
Columbia University<br/>
Advisors:
[**Richard Axel**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Axel) and
[**Larry Abbott**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Abbott)

Project: see project

2011-2012<br/>
MIT<br/>
Advisor: [**Elly Nedivi**](https://nedivilab.mit.edu/)

Project: I studied the short-term structural dynamics of inhibitory and excitatory synapses in excitatory and inhibitory V1 neurons by chronically imaging their dendritic arbors using 2-photon exitation

2009<br/>
Howard Hughes Research Campus, Janelia Farm<br/>
Advisor: [**Scott Sternson**](https://www.janelia.org/lab/sternson-lab)

Project: assisting my post-doc mentor, Yexica Aponte, we asked whether optogenetic activation of NPY/AgRP neurons in the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus is sufficient to induce hunger

2008-2011<br/>
Cornell University<br/>
Advisor: [**Joe Fetcho**](http://pages.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/Fetcho/)

Project: I attempted to develop a method to deliver DNA to a given neuron's pre-synaptic partners through retrograde viral transport in larval zebrafish
